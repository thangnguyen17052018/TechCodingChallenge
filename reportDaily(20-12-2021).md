* Today done/learned:
   - Understand more about OOPS Concepts:
	+ Abstraction.
	+ Encapsulation.
	+ Polymorphism.
	+ Inheritance (*).
	+ Association.
	+ Aggregation.
	+ Composition (*).
   - Static nested class & java inner class.
   - Composition vs Inheritance.
   - Lambdas, method references.
   - Understand why we need every SOLID principles, still research more how to apply:
	+ SRP.
	+ OCP.
	+ LSP.
	+ ISP.
	+ DIP.
   - Make FirstThinking about TechCodingChallenge exercise.
   - Still read Clean Code book. 
* Stuck:
   - "Favor composition over inheritance", want to dive deeper more.
   - Dependency Inversion Principle is "hard to understand".
   - Need to consider the benefits before apply any principle.	
* Tomorrow (optional):
   - Try apply OOP, SOLID to exercise by inital way - modeling problem.
   - Continues read Clean Code book and try something.
   - Research some design pattern to solve and understand more (What pattern should choose to "determine" and "operate" various commands of whose (C, L, R, B, Q)).
